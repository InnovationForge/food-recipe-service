# food-recipe-service (FRS)
A recipe API that provides information about various food recipes, ingredients, and cooking instructions.

## FRS Solution Design overview
Developing a food recipe service that provides information about various recipes, ingredients, and cooking instructions can be a delicious project. Here's a high-level outline of the steps you can follow to implement the desired features:

* Data Modeling: Design the data models for your application. This might include entities like Recipe, Ingredient, Category, Cuisine, and any other related entities you may need. Consider the relationships between these entities.
* Data Storage: Choose a database solution to store your recipe data. Spring Boot supports various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. Select the one that suits your needs and configure the data source.
* Recipe Management: Implement functionality for managing recipes. Create endpoints or functionality to add, edit, and delete recipes. Include features like recipe title, description, cooking time, serving size, and difficulty level.
* Ingredient Management: Create functionality to manage ingredients. Implement endpoints or functionality to add, edit, and delete ingredients. Include features like ingredient name, quantity, measurement unit, and optional notes.
* Recipe Categorization: Categorize recipes based on different criteria such as cuisine type, dietary restrictions, meal type, or ingredient tags. Implement functionality to filter and search recipes based on these categories.
* Recipe Retrieval: Develop endpoints or functionality to retrieve recipe details, including ingredients, cooking instructions, and any additional notes or tips. Consider providing visual representations of recipes, such as images or videos.
* User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for your recipe service. You can create a web-based frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. Alternatively, create a mobile app using frameworks like React Native or Flutter.
* User Management: Implement user registration, login, and authentication functionality. Use Spring Security to handle user authentication and authorization. Include features like user profiles, favorite recipes, and the ability to save personalized collections of recipes.
* Recipe Recommendations: Implement features to provide recipe recommendations based on user preferences, such as favorite cuisines or dietary restrictions. Consider using machine learning algorithms or recommendation systems to enhance recipe suggestions.
* Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the functionality of your application. You can use tools like JUnit and Mockito for testing in Spring Boot.
* Deployment: Deploy your application to a hosting platform or a cloud provider. You can use services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku for deployment.

Ensure that you handle user-contributed recipes responsibly, respect copyright laws, and provide proper attribution for recipe sources.

This outline should give you a starting point for developing your Food Recipe Service. Make sure to explore Spring Boot documentation for detailed implementation guidance. Enjoy cooking up your project!
